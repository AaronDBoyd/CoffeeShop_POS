## Name of Student: Aaron Boyd

## Name of Project: Dew Drop's Coffee Shop POS System

## Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
### This project aims to be a realistic/viable Point of Sales System for a hypothetical coffee shop.

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Create Checks that include multiple items, modifiers and total price.
* Store created checks in a database.
* Checks can "closed" and will display a correct change amount.
* Style components.

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to *your* track, and *your* language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific

* JavaScript
* React Js
* CSS
* Firebase
* npm 

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* Add component/page to view instructions on making drinks.
* Let different users sign in to see/modify checks that belong to them.
* Add Admin privileges to to control things like discounts.
* Allow users to "clock-in" and "clock-out" if their shift.
* Create component to view statistics such as how many drinks have been sold.
* Allow users to split checks.
* Allow users to transfer checks.
* Create seating chart to assign checks to tables. 

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

* Some sort of authentication software.
* I would like to find some software that would help create animations for the statistics page/other features.  
* Possibly Redux/Context.
